# Stacked-to-Grouped Bars

A visualization example alternating between stacked and grouped layouts built
with [D3.js v4](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v4.2.2), and based on 
this [older example from Mike Bostock for d3.js v3](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3943967)

## Stacked view

The age groups for each US state are stacked up to show the total population in
relation to the others.

## Grouped view

Toggling from stacked to grouped, the total populations for each state are now
broken out into their separate age group categories.
