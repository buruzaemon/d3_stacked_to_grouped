# Stacked-to-Grouped Bars

A visualization example for switching between stacked and grouped layouts based
on this [older example from Mike Bostock for d3.js v3](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3943967)

## Stacked view

The age groups for each US state are stacked up to show the total population in
relation to the others.

## Grouped view

The total populations for each state are now broken out into their separate age group
categories.
